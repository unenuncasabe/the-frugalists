Graph database of the Frugal Science Course by Manu Prakash and the PrakashLab (Stanford)
This is my humble attempt to synthesize the magnitude of what happened during the course. 
Though I'm not in STEM per se, I do realize the greatness of collaboration. Therefore, I created a better way to visualize the links between collaborators, institutions, and projects. That way, we can easily find new relations among us, facilitating collaborations in frugal science and design.

To visualize the graph as it is configured, you must install Neo4j (https://neo4j.com/download-neo4j-now/) in your computer (is free, you must create an account).
Once you're there, create a new DBMS and open it. Copy and paste the code on the console, or import the CSV file.
Neo4j has this amazing viasualization app (BLOOM) that allows you to interact and make more human-like queries (otherwise you must learn Cypher), you have install it (is the main page, where you create a new DBMS).
HAVE FUN!
